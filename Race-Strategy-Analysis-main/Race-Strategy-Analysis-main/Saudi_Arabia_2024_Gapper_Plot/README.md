## Early Safety Car

- With the safety car coming out on lap 7 due to a mistake from Stroll, most of the grid chose to pit.

- Only Norris and Hamilton remained on their starting Medium tyres in the front running group, bringing Norris to the lead on track.

- The timing of the saftey car forced those who chose to pit to run for longer on the Hard compound tyre in their second stint than originally planned.

## McLaren vs Hamilton

- Piastri, having pitted under the safety car, caught up to Hamilton on lap 15, but was unable to pass due to lacking straight-line speed and DRS efficiency. Despite this, his finishing position was likely unaffected, since the pace of Lecelerc's Ferrari in third place is shown to be greater than what Piastri was ultimately able to manage when running in clear air.

- With both Norris and Hamilton running equivalent strategies, for Norris to remain in front it was essential to match pace with Hamilton from laps 10-35, after which Hamilton chose to pit. McLaren responded immediately, pitting on the subsequent lap and managing to cover off the undercut at lap 38. From this stage to the finish, Norris was able to hold off Hamilton despite the lacking straight-line performance.

## Haas Teamwork

- With Magnussen earning 20 seconds worth of penalties, his chance of earning points was minimal. At this stage his race was sacrificed in aid of his teammate Hulkenberg, who was running in 10th and still required a pit stop before the finish. On lap 21 Magnussen begins holding up the group of cars behind in order to build a pit stop window for Hulkenberg. The sharp decline in pace for Magnussen and those behind can be seen bewteen laps 21 and 33, at which point Hulkenberg changes tyres and retains net track position.
