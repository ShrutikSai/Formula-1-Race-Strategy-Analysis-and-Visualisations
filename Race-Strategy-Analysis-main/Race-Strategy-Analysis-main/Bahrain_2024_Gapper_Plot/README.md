![Bahrain 2024 Gapper Plot](/Bahrain_2024_Gapper_Plot/Bahrain_2024_Gapper_Plot_Reference_Time.png)

## Front-Runners
- Verstappen was able to run the longest first stint of the race, and completed it with the fastest average pace.

- Verstappen's middle stint is where the majority of his winning margin was opened up.

- Perez maintained position over Sainz with a slightly earlier first stop, maintaining position by protecting against the undercut for the second stop.

- Lecelerc dropped the majority of time to his teammate in the middle stint in following closely behind Russell, but was able to overtake the Mercedes with fresher tyres in the final stint.

## Midfield

- While the two McLaren's remained closely matched in the opening two stints, the gap increased at the second stop and remained until the finish.

- Hamilton was able to undercut Piastri due to a slow pitstop, both running with similar pace for the final stint.

- Despite a consistent middle stint for Alonso, he was undercut by Zhou and Stroll at his second pitstop, but the significantly fresher tyres enable him to pass easily in the final stint with pace equivalent to that of the 4 teams ahead, opening an 18s lead over his teammate.

## Backmarkers

- From 11th and below all cars were 1 lap down.

- Zhou and Magnussen's longer final stints meant that they were caught by Tsunoda and Ricciardo but managed to maintain track position.

- Albon was running closely behind Magnussen during the second stint and ahead of Ricciardo, but the attempted overcut on Magnussen results in a loss of position to Ricciardo at the final pitstop.

- For the two Alpines, the 3-stop (completed by Gasly) was of similar overall race time to the 2-stop (completed by Ocon).

- Despite an opening lap incident, Hulkenberg was able to undercut Gasly at the final pitstop and overtake Ocon on track in the final stint.

- Bottas had an issue during the second pitstop and dropped out of the battle with the two Alpines.
